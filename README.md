## Welcome on my profile üëã

Hello, my name is Kamil and im 27yo.

Here you can find some of my repos, that for me are worth being public.

My *newest* project that i work on is [Ollama GUI Chat](https://github.com/tomteipl/Ollama-GUI-Chat).
Its super light app that lets you talk with your LLMs thru **modern** and **compact** GUI.
Check out the repo to see the features ‚ú®

Currently im learning `Python` which i love so far. I love learning new things and im not scared of them!

If you find anything worth your *click*, leave a ‚≠ê!
